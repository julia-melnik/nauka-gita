      I think I'm losing my mind<br>
      Trying to stay inside the lines<br>
      It's like I'm running in place<br>
      How you keep staying the same?<br>
      Baby, I, I guess I'm something different<br>
      And I'm okay with that<br>
      I can't fake no more smiles<br>
      That shit gon' drive me mad<br>
      I'm focused on the future<br>
      Don't care 'bout nothin' else<br><br>
      Oh oh oh<br>
      I'm better by myself<br>
      I'm better by myself<br>
      I don't need no one else<br>
      I'm better by myself<br>
      Myself<br><br>
      Don't wanna answer questions<br>
      Just want your company<br>
      It's all good on the surface<br>
      Show me what's underneath<br>
      I'm not concerned with drama<br>
      I left that shit in school<br>
      I'm more concerned with commas<br>
      Than keeping up with you<br>
      Keep that away from me.<br><br>
